      lyrics: "I wanna hold you Till the mountains turn into sand. Oh my God! What happened to all those days Before we were bruised. Before we were cut loose To drown in your wake. I can't breathe underwater. Like I used to 'Fore I met you. I, just can't remember January, straight through December. My collective memories are in shambles And so are my scruples. I'm outside your window Throwin' bricks at the moon. I can't breathe underwater. Like I used to 'Fore I met you"
